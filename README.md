# Welcome to TrashUno
Honestly, there's not much to say about this project.
This project is called TrashUno because it is hot garbage.

## Backstory
Freshman year, Computer Programming II
The assignment was to create a (somewhat) functional game. My classmates chose things like Plants VS Zombies.
The project was due on May 27, 2022 at 11:59 PM

I, however, regretfully chose to make a UNO game.

Needless to say, that didn't go too well. It was fun to attempt to work on it, but it didn't work out too well.

I got 40/40 on this project for meeting the requirements of the project, regardless of it being incomplete.

## Contributing
Created with Visual Studio. Contributions are open if you'd like. I don't expect much from this; I just wanted to show off my previous work.
Plenty of bugs can be found if you want to contribute. For example, when starting the game, same-colored/numbered cards may (or may not) fail to match.
This is one of my lower-priority projects, as it's years old and hasn't been touched since. 

## "Playing" the game
First of all, good luck. The .exe file is named `FinalProject.exe`
This file WILL have bugs. You may not be able to run it without Visual Studio installed.
